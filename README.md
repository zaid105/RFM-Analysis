# RFM-Analysis
## What is RFM?
RFM is a method used to analyze customer value. RFM stands for RECENCY, Frequency, and Monetary.

Recency: <br>
    How much time has elapsed since a customer’s last activity or transaction with the brand? Activity is usually a purchase, although variations are sometimes used, e.g., the last visit to a website or use of a mobile app. In most cases, the more recently a customer has interacted or transacted with a brand, the more likely that customer will be responsive to communications from the brand. 
<br><br>
Frequency:<br>
    How often has a customer transacted or interacted with the brand during a particular period of time? Clearly, customers with frequent activities are more engaged, and probably more loyal, than customers who rarely do so. And one-time-only customers are in a class of their own. 
<br><br>
Monetary:<br>
    Also referred to as “monetary value,” this factor reflects how much a customer has spent with the brand during a particular period of time. Big spenders should usually be treated differently than customers who spend little. Looking at monetary divided by frequency indicates the average purchase amount – an important secondary factor to consider when segmenting customers. 
## Why is it needed?
RFM Analysis is a marketing framework that is used to understand and analyze customer behaviour based on the above three factors RECENCY, Frequency, and Monetary.

The RFM Analysis will help the businesses to segment their customer base into different homogenous groups so that they can engage with each group with different targeted marketing strategies.
